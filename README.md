Considerations:\
-> Using autowireds is not a good approach. Int his case, constructors with constants and used to improve efficiency and
ensure object integrity\
-> Database is H2, this means it is self-generated inside the project and erased when project is shutting down.\
-> No docker needed on this example, although it would be great to have.\
-> Database constraints implemented in jpa layer, although it is implemented on mapper layer, too\
-> All get endpoints should be pageable, not return everything.\
-> If queries are getting complex, using Pageable and Filtering objects from spring boot would be a good choice.\
-> When searching, I put title and author by full match, but it should look for "like", since we don't filter author
by "Luis de GÃ³ngora", we want to see Gongora's books by typing only "gon".\
-> using DTO prevents many attacks, this is automatically done by mapstruct\
-> using lombok to prevent boilerplate code\
-> mapper layer also validates data\
-> app should be tested, but generating context is an overkill for this time. I'd use gherkin to test user Histories 
and junit for functional testing \
